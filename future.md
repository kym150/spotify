## Conclusions
In conclusion , we were able to successfully create a playlist generator that met our requirements. In conclusion, we were able to successfully create a playlist generator that met our requirements. It can work for both the 'cold start' problem and can take a range of themes as an input. 


## Future Work

In the future we would love to roll-out and user-test our playlists. At present, we don’t have a measure of how successful our playlists are, and we don’t know how successful they are in relative subgroups of the population. Ways to measure the success of our playlists would include surveys of users (who might, for example, rate the playlist generated for them on a scale of 1 to 10), and the number of skips (noting the constraint outlined above in relation to background listening). We could then make adjustments to the models, and A/B test them on users to find the playlist generator that is rated highest. 

We would also like to add more features to our playlist generator. For example individuals could pick, on a sliding scale, how ‘new’ they’d like their playlist to be. If they chose 20%, then 80% of songs would come from playlists shared with their chosen songs, and 20% of songs might share similar tags, for example, but would be ‘new’ to the listener.
