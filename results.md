## Results

Our result: a recommender system that can take a song as an input and produce a list of desired length. For example, after inputting the song title 'Rain is a Good Thing' by Luke Bryan, we are given the following playlist.

```python
playlist_country = SR.recommend_me_some_songs(database, unique_tracks, 'Rain Is a Good Thing', 'Luke Bryan')
```

We were able to test our model on a range of inputs and genres (for example, christmas songs and pop songs) and it made great playlists that we would enjoy listening to. The playlist generator also allows you to input just a song name, and if there are multiple songs with that name, lists the artists who have songs with that track name. 

```python
playlist_bad_romance = SR.recommend_me_some_songs(database, unique_tracks,'Bad Romance')
```
