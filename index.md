## Project by Kysie Miao, Helen Yang and Catherine Marks

## Project Overview

This project has two goals: firstly, to develop an automatic playlist generator for Spotify based on a base playlist and some user context information, including intent, emotion, location, and playlist "purpose". Secondly, create a model for Spotify to find songs for new playlists with relatively few prior playlist entries.

## Motivation

Music recommender systems are now extremely popular, largely due to the availability of streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora. In January 2018, Spotify reported 159 million monthly active users, and 70 million paid subscribers.  While users can create playlists for themselves and to share with others, music recommender systems are attractive because they can auto-generate playlists for individual listeners, which, with simple additional information can be tailored for desired mood (‘chill’, ‘happy’), and situation (‘driving’, ‘party’).  We wanted to see if we could use existing datasets on Spotify playlists and songs, to create a personalized playlist recommender that could be used cold, or with some inputted contextual information.
